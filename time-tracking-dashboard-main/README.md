## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Something I had never used was the svg images, in this challenge I learn a lot about them and how usefull are for the front end development. 

```html
<svg class="points" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="36px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="36px" fill=" hsl(235, 45%, 61%)" cursor='pointer'><path d="M0 0h24v24H0V0z" fill="none"/><path d="M6 10c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2zm12 0c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2zm-6 0c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2z"/></svg>
```
```js
var puntos = document.querySelectorAll('.points');
puntos.forEach(punto => {
        punto.addEventListener('mouseover',()=>{
            punto.setAttribute('fill','#FFFFFF')
        })
        punto.addEventListener('mouseout',()=>{
            punto.setAttribute('fill','hsl(235, 45%, 61%)')
        })
    })
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects I will used more de svg images, I will use CSS Grid for duture projects, using only flexbox was a resizing nightmare. 
Other thing I am going to practice more is the use of .json files, because in this challenge I was not able to fetch the data from the file and end up copy pasting the content of the file in the Script file. (if some one knows how to do it please send me an email explaining the process)
